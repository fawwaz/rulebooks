# SET-UP

Shuffle all the sushi cards well. Place them in a face-down draw pile in the centre of the table.

# PLAYING THE GAME
The game takes place over 3 rounds.  
At the start of each round, cards are dealt from the draw pile, face-down to each player.  
- In a 2 player game, deal 10 cards to each player.
- In a 3 player game, deal 9 cards to each player.
- In a 4 player game, deal 8 cards to each player.
- In a 5 player game, deal 7 cards to each player.

The players take the cards into their hands.  
Throughout the game, the cards in players’ hands are kept secret.

## Game Turn:
1. Each turn, all players choose any 1 card from their hand that they’d like to keep.   
2. They place this card face-down on the table in front of them.  

3. When every player has done this, all the chosen cards are turned face-up.  
These cards remain with the player until the end of the round, when they are scored.
It is helpful to place cards of the same type together.

4. After revealing cards, the players pass their remaining hand face-down to the player on their left. 

5. The players pick up their new hands, and the next turn begins, with players having a smaller hand to choose from.

## Using wasabi
If a player chooses a squid, salmon or egg nigiri card, and already has a wasabi card in front of them, then this nigiri must be placed on top of the wasabi. This is to show that the nigiri was dipped in the wasabi and tripled in value!  

Only 1 nigiri card may be placed on each wasabi card. A player may have multiple wasabi cards in front of them.

## Using chopsticks
If a player already has a chopsticks card in front of them, they may take 2 cards from their hand in a turn.  

Here’s how it works: The player chooses the first card they would like as usual. Before everyone else reveals their chosen cards, the player calls out “Sushi Go!” and takes a second card from their hand, also placing it facedown on the table. Then all the players reveal the cards they have chosen.

Before hands are passed on, the player who used chopsticks picks up their chopsticks card and puts it into their hand. This means the chopsticks will now be passed on, and other players may take them to use again.

A player may have multiple chopsticks cards in front of them, but may only use 1 per turn.

# END OF THE ROUND

When the 1 remaining card of each hand is passed on, the player receiving it simply places it face-up with the other cards they have collected. Often this final card won’t be much use, but sometimes an unfortunate player will be forced to leave you with something valuable!

The players now score their cards as follows:

## Sushi rolls

The players each add up the sushi roll icons at the top of all their sushi roll cards.   
The player with the most scores 6 points. If multiple players are tied for the most  they split the points
evenly (ignoring any remainder) and no second place points are awarded. The player with the second most sushi roll icons scores 3 points.

If multiple players are tied for second place, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).

### Example:
- Player A has 5 sushi roll icons.
- Player B has 3,
- Player C has 2 and Player D has 3.

Player A has the most and so scores 6 points. Players B and D tie for second place, and so divide the 3 points between them, scoring 1 point each.

Player C scores nothing.

Note: A player must have at least 1 sushi roll card to get any points in the sushi roll scoring. That is, having 0 icons cannot count as second place.

## Tempura

A set of 2 tempura cards scores 5 points. A single tempura card is worth nothing.   
A player may score multiple sets of tempura in a round.

## Sashimi

A set of 3 sashimi cards scores 10 points.  
A single sashimi card or a set of only 2 is worth nothing.  
A player may score multiple sets of sashimi in a round, although this is very hard to do!

## Dumplings
The more dumplings a player has, the more points they will score, as follows:

| Dumplings | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5 or More |
|-----------|---|---|---|----|----|
| Points    | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 15 |

## Nigiri and wasabi
A squid nigiri scores 3 points. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 9.

A salmon nigiri scores 2 points. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 6.

An egg nigiri scores 1 point. If it is on top of a wasabi card it scores 3.

A wasabi card with no nigiri on top of it scores nothing.

## Unused chopsticks
A chopsticks card scores nothing. The players announce their scores for the round. 


Ongoing scores can be kept on paper. All cards are now discarded face-up beside the draw pile. The only exception are pudding cards which are kept in front of the players to be scored at the end of the game.


# END OF THE GAME
After the third round is scored, there will be some cards remaining in the draw deck. These are ignored. Now it’s time for dessert! The players now score any pudding cards they have collected throughout the game.

## Puddings
The player with the most pudding cards scores 6 points. If multiple players are tied for the most, they split the points evenly (ignoring any remainder).  

The player with the least pudding cards (which may be 0) loses 6 points. If multiple players are tied for the least, they split the lost points evenly (ignoring any remainder).

## Example:
- Player A has 4 pudding cards,
- Player B has 3 
- and Players C and D each have 0. 

Player A has the most and so scores 6 points.   
Players C and D tie for the least and so divide the negative 6 points between them, each losing 3 points.  

On the rare occasion that all players have the same number of pudding cards, no one scores anything for them.

Important:
In a 2 player game, no one loses any points for puddings. Only the points for most pudding cards are awarded.

Players add up their scores from the 3 rounds, and what they scored for pudding cards.

Whoever has the most points is the winner! In the case of a tie, whoever has the most pudding cards is the winner!

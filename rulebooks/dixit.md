# Contents

* One game board inside the box (scoring track)
* 84 cards
* 36 voting tokens in 6 different colours numbered from 1 to 6
* 6 wooden rabbits (rabbeeples!)

# Setup

Each player chooses one rabbit and place it on the space 0 of the scoring track. Shuffle the 84 images and give 6 of them to each player. Make a draw pile with the remaining cards.

* With 4 players, each one takes 4 voting tokens (from 1 to 4).
* With 5 players, each one takes 5 voting tokens (from 1 to 5).
* With 6 players, each one takes 6 voting tokens (from 1 to 6).

*Note: Do not show your hand of cards to anyone.*

# Game turn

## The storyteller

One player is the storyteller for the turn. He looks at the 6 images in his hand. From one of these, he makes up a sentence and says it out loud *(without showing the card to the other players)*.

The sentence can take different forms: it can be made of one word or more, it can even be a sound. The sentence can be either  invented or be inspired from an existing work of art *(poetry or song sample, movie title, proverb, etc)*.

*Who is the storyteller for the first turn? The first player to describe one of their cards aloud will be the storyteller for the first turn.*

## Choosing a card for the storyteller

The other players select amongst their 6 images the one that best matches the sentence made up by the storyteller.

Then, each of them gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others.

The storyteller shuffles his card with all the received cards. He then randomly places them face up on the table. The card on the left will be number 1, the one next to it will be number 2, and so on…

## Finding the storyteller’s image: the vote

The goal of the other players is to find which image is from the storyteller amongst the displayed ones. Each player secretly votes for the card that he believes belongs to the storyteller *(who doesn’t vote)*.

To do so, he places face down in front of him the voting token corresponding to the image he voted for. Once everybody has voted, all the voting tokens are revealed and placed on their corresponding images.

*Note: You’re not allowed to vote for your own image.*

## Scoring

* If all players have found the storyteller’s image, or if none have found it, then the storyteller doesn’t score any points and everyone else scores 2 points.
* In any other case, the storyteller scores 3 points and so do the players who found his image.
* Each player, except the storyteller, scores one point for each vote that was placed on their image.

The players move their rabbits along the scoring track by the same number of spaces as points scored.

## End of turn

Each player draws a new card to bring their hand up to 6 once more. The storyteller for the new turn is the player to the left of the current one *(and we keep going clockwise for the following turns)*.

# Game End

The game ends when the last card from the pack has been drawn. The player who’s the furthest on the scoring track is the winner.

# Variants

**3 players:** each player has 7 cards, instead of 6. Every player except the storyteller gives 2 cards, instead of one. So we end up with 5 displayed cards to choose from.

**Scoring:** When only one player has found the storyteller’s card, they both score 4 points, instead of 3.

**Mimes or songs:** in this variant, the storyteller has the possibility to either sing a song or some music that could be somehow related to the card, or even mime it. The rest of the game stays the same.

Finally, nothing prevents you from mixing the different variants together or creating some of your own!
